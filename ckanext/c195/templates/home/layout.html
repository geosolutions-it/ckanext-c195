            AnaEE (Analysis and Experimentation on Ecosystems) will pave the way for understanding the
            complex impact of todayâ€™s multiple, interacting global change drivers on terrestrial and
            aquatic continental ecosystems across Europe. It will forge evidence-based adaptation and mitigation
            strategies that assure plant, soil, water, biodiversity and ecosystem health today and in the future.
            <br/><br/>
            Those strategies are needed to maintain essential services to society, including carbon sequestration,
            food security, clean water, biodiversity. Characteristic to AnaEE its versatile facilities that can simulate
            environmental drivers from land-use change, pollution, biological invasions, rising atmospheric greenhouse gases concentrations,
            and to increasing extreme events such as droughts and heatwaves. AnaEE has the potential to look into the future,
            thanks to the integrative and coordinated usage of its experimental, analytical and modelling facilities<a href="https://www.anaee.eu/" target="_blank" >
